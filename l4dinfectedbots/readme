-How to set the correct Convar-
1. Set special limit
-l4d_infectedbots_charger_limit
-l4d_infectedbots_boomer_limit 
-l4d_infectedbots_hunter_limit
-l4d_infectedbots_jockey_limit
-l4d_infectedbots_smoker_limit
-l4d_infectedbots_spitter_limit
-l4d_infectedbots_tank_limit
These 7 values combined together must greater than or equal to 
-l4d_infectedbots_max_specials
Note that it does not counts witch in all gamemode, but it counts tank in all gamemode.

2. adjust special limit if 5+ alive players
For example.
-l4d_infectedbots_max_specials "4"
-l4d_infectedbots_add_specials "2"
-l4d_infectedbots_add_specials_scale "3"
This means that if server has 5+ alive survivors, each 3 players join, max specials limit plus 2
So if there are 10 alive survivors, specials limit: 4+2+2 = 8

if you don't want to adjust specials limit, set
-l4d_infectedbots_add_specials "0" 

3. adjust tank health if 5+ alive players
For example
-l4d_infectedbots_adjust_tankhealth_enable "1"
-l4d_infectedbots_default_tankhealth "4000"
-l4d_infectedbots_add_tankhealth "1200"
-l4d_infectedbots_add_tankhealth_scale "3"
This means that if server has 5+ alive survivors, each 3 players join, tank health increase 1200hp
So if there are 10 alive survivors, tank health: 4000+1200+1200 = 6400hp

To close this feature, do not want to overrides tank HP by this plugin, set
-l4d_infectedbots_adjust_tankhealth_enable "0"

4. adjust zombie zommon limit if 5+ alive players
For example
- l4d_infectedbots_adjust_commonlimit_enable "1"
- l4d_infectedbots_default_commonlimit "30"
- l4d_infectedbots_add_commonlimit_scale "1"
- l4d_infectedbots_add_commonlimit "2"
This means that if server has 5+ alive survivors, each 1 players join, zommon limit increase 2
So if there are 10 alive survivors, common limit: 30+2+2+2+2+2+2 = 42

To close this feature, do not want to overrides zombie common limit by this plugin, set
-l4d_infectedbots_adjust_commonlimit_enable "0"

5.adjust special infected spawn timer
Reduce certain value to spawn timer based per alive player,For example
-l4d_infectedbots_spawn_time_max "60"
-l4d_infectedbots_spawn_time_min "30"
-l4d_infectedbots_adjust_spawn_times "1"
-l4d_infectedbots_adjust_reduced_spawn_times_on_player "2"
If there are 5 "ALIVE" survivors in game, special infected spawn timer[max: 60-(5*2) = 50, min: 30-(5*2) = 20]

To close this feature, set 
-l4d_infectedbots_adjust_spawn_times "0"

6.how to spawn tank
For example.
-l4d_infectedbots_tank_limit "2"
-l4d_infectedbots_tank_spawn_probability "5"
This means that each time 5% chance to spawn tank instead of infected bot. 
Note that if tank limit is reached or is 0, still don't spawn tank(does not affect director tanks)

7. Play infected team in coop/survival
For example.
-l4d_infectedbots_coop_versus "1"
-l4d_infectedbots_admin_coop_versus "1"
-l4d_infectedbots_coop_versus_human_limit "2"
Only adm can join the infected team, and there are only 2 infected team slots for real player

If you want everyone can join infected, then set
-l4d_infectedbots_admin_coop_versus "0"

make tank always be playable by real infected player
-l4d_infectedbots_coop_versus_tank_playable "1" 

8. Spawn range
Must be careful to adjust, these convars will also affect common zombie spawn range.
-l4d_infectedbots_spawn_range_max "2000"
-l4d_infectedbots_spawn_range_min "0"
-l4d_infectedbots_spawn_range_final "0" 

Make infected player spawn near very close by survivors for better gaming experience
-l4d_infectedbots_spawn_range_min "0" 
-l4d_infectedbots_spawn_range_final "0"

9. Spawn Infected together
bots will only spawn when all other bot spawn timers are at zero, and them spawn together
-l4d_infectedbots_coordination "1" 

Plugin will disable spawning infected bot when a tank is on the field.
-l4d_infectedbots_spawns_disabled_tank "1" 

-Command-
!ji - JoinInfected
!js - JoinSurvivors
(infected only) !infhud - toggle HUD on/off for themselves
(infected only) !zs - suicide infected player himself (if infected get stuck or something)
(adm only) !timer - control special zombies spawn timer
(adm only) !zlimit - control max special zombies limit
