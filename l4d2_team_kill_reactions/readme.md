* <details><summary>How does it work?</summary>

    * Unknown to many people, there are unused lines for all 8 survivors where they react to players team killing each other, this plugin restores these reactions.
    * When a player either incapacitates or kills another player, someone else on the team will react
        * The player who did the team killing will vocalize sorry
        * If it was just an incapacitation, the incapacitated player will react by swearing

# 中文說明
玩家TK導致隊友倒地或死亡，能有更多的角色語音互動

* 原理
    * 遊戲內依然有很多互相友傷的語音反應，這插件嘗試讓這些語音出現
    * 當玩家造成另一位玩家倒地或死亡時，
        * 一位隊友會有反應說"小心點"，造成傷害的玩家會說"Sorry"
        * 倒地玩家會罵你一句話
